## Overview

**RDE VeriTest** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to assist drivers in performing Real Driving Emissions (RDE) tests according to EU legislation. The application provides real-time monitoring and guidance during vehicle emissions testing, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Monitoring:** Tracks vehicle speed and idle time using Geolocation API integration
- **Test Boundary Verification:** Monitors 11 test boundary conditions with location accuracy within 4.6 meters
- **EU Compliance:** Designed to meet Real Driving Emissions testing requirements
- **Progressive Web App:** Accessible on any device with offline capabilities
- **Technical Documentation:** Comprehensive 30-page technical report detailing project methodology and conclusions

## Technical Implementation

The PWA was built using modern web technologies to ensure reliability and accuracy during critical emissions testing:

- **Frontend:** React.js with JavaScript for responsive UI
- **Geolocation API:** Real-time position tracking and speed calculation
- **PWA Features:** Offline functionality and app-like experience
- **Data Validation:** Continuous verification of test parameters and boundary conditions

## Project Deliverables

- **Working PWA:** Fully functional application available at rde-vt.netlify.app
- **Technical Report:** Comprehensive 30-page documentation of the project
- **Source Code:** Complete implementation available on GitHub
- **Test Results:** Validated performance with EU RDE testing standards

## Technologies Used
